This project is a collaboration with Dr. Anas Ghrab (http://anas.ghrab.tn/en/), professor of musicology at the Music Institute in Sousse, Tunisia.

The goal of this project is to analyze a corpus of old music texts using modern tools of data science, natural language processing and machine learning.

The documents are automatically pulled from an online database maintained by Dr. Anas Ghrab, residing at http://saramusik.org/. The database currently comprises only 37 documents, but is expected to increase to hundreds of documents within a year. 

The documents are encoded in XML format based on the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). In addition to the textual content of the document, each xml file contains some metadata such as the author, the source of the document, and a set of index terms or tags.

Some of the research questions we aim to answer include: 

1. Are documents of the same tag more similar than documents of different tags?
2. Can we group the documents in a small number of clusters based on their content similarity? 
And to what extent do these clusters agree with the manual tags?
3. How similar/dissimilar are documents of the same/different tag, geographic location, and time period?
