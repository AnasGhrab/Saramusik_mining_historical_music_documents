The goal of this project is to analyze a corpus of hundreds of old music texts using modern tools of data science, 
namely natural language processing and machine learning.

The raw data currently consists of the 37 documents encoded in XML format. Each XML file basically contains the text content of the document 
along with some metadata, including the author, the source of the document, and a set of index terms or tags.

Some of the research questions we aim to answer include: 

1. Are documents of the same tag more similar than documents of different tags?
2. Can we group the documents in a small number of clusters based on their content similarity? 
And to what extent do these clusters agree with the manual tags?
3. How similar/dissimilar are documents of the same/different tag, geographic location, and time period?
